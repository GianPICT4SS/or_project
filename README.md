## 2020_ORTA_AntennaActivation

In many TLC domains and applications ground network of stations and gen- erally speaking antennas are used in order to perform some operations providing different kinds of communication and messaging patterns. As a consequence, there are many problems that must be addressed. Usually, antennas have a defined cov- ered area, computing capacity and interoperability characteristics. Depending on the domain and on the application, antennas are usually placed in order to opti- mize some metrics, often related to the performance or to the cost of the system. For example, in different domains, antennas are placed in order to cover an entire objective area, providing a good QoS and minimizing the total number of antennas - and thus the total cost of setup and maintenance of the TLC system. These type of problems are usually addressed during the planning and the simulation of the system and can be solved using ILP e LP models.
Because of different reasons antennas can be mutually exclusive, for example because their signals are broadcasted using incompatible multiplexing strategies.
